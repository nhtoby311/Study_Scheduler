# Study_Scheduler
----------------------------
# Intro
Are you tired of planning study schedule before the big exam? Then, are you failing to follow your own schedule, too frequently that by the end of the day, you archieve nothing at all? Well my friend, you need Jesus! If you can't affort Jesus, why dont you give this program a shot? Study Scheduler helps reduce the amount of time you spend on planning the study plans. Maybe.
# How it works? 
- You choose the deadline(haha.. no u dont), then the program calculated the period you have before the deadline.
- You create a subject with the amounts of topics and subtopics you need to cover. 
- Then, after some calculation, you will receive a table shows how much subtopics you need to complete for each day in order to finish the subjects by the deadline.
### What makes *__Study_Scheduler__* stands out? 
- I basically code 3 methods just to find the days aparts of two given dates, while i can do the same thing with java.time...
